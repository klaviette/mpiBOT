# mpiBOT

**Discord bot for TCG pricing information and tracking quality of life (QOL)**

---

## Overview

mpiBOT is a Discord bot designed to provide TCG collectors and investors with easy access to pricing information and market tracking tools. It aims to help users stay updated on card values, trends, and portfolio performance, making the management of Pokémon card collections simpler and more efficient.

Sooner or later, once I can implement data on other types of TCG IPs (not just Pokémon), I will rename the service to **TCGI** or **TCG Index**.
